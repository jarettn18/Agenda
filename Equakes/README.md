Earthquake Data Mining

Author: Jarett Nishijo

A data mining and visualization project where we wrote python functions 
to parse through a csv file of earthquakes that occured
in the past decade or so. 

Able to filter earthquakes by magnitude and plot earthquakes
on a world map with a dot size corresponding to their magnitude.

All code is in p9_equakes_vis.py
