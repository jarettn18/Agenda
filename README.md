Basic Algorithms and Data Structures

All projects are coded in python 3.7 and include a README.md with a detailed description
about the function of each program. Listed below are short overviews of each project

#Agenda-Master:
A short introduction to OOP through appointment objects.
appt.py checks for conflicts between any of those appointment objects

using UnitTest in python

#Waldo-mini-Master:
